simple-wixel-starter-framework
==============================

a Simple-as-possible responsive Sass starter framework.

###Why?
Simple. Frameworks are way to big and starting a project from scratch takes too long.

###What?
It's a bare basics framework, it's meant to be hacked, modified and not at all a dependancy yet sets a very organised platform to build upon.

###Includes
* Box-sizing reset.
* Simple easy to understand file structure.
* a Mobile first 12 column responsive grid.
* Typography reset with helpers and easily configurable settings.
* Color settings.

Get really Sassy with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and keep your naughty friends inline with [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) (This framework loves both)

###Installation
We recommend installing the framework using the [initializer 'setup.sh' file](https://github.com/Wixel/initializer) but you could,
Install via bower using `bower install wixel-framework`

Just drop the files in your Sass folder and either use the main.scss file as your main sass file or copy it's content into the top of your current stylesheet.

###Using the typography
Very simple, configure the values in the _base.scss file

###Using the grid
The grid borrows the same naming convention as the foundation framework.
